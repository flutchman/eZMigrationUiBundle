# eZMigrationUiBundle Todo list

- Add translations in eZ Platform currently supported languages (cf crowdin)
- Add actions through AdminUi:
    - Launch migration
    - Revert migration
    - Export migration report
    - ...
- Migration script user interface (instead of cli)

Please feel free to submit any good ideas you might have and would want to see :)
