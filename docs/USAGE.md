# eZMigrationUiBundle Usage

## Use eZ Platform Admin Ui

In your Back Office (or Admin Ui) interface, below `Admin` you should find a new tab called `Migration state`.

For example, in an ezplatform-demo instance the access should look like:
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/migration/state](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/migration/state)

## What it does

- Display registered project migrations
- Display migrations locations (hover)
- Display curretn status
- Display migration's latest execution date
